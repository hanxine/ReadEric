# ReadEric (He/Him/His)

The introduction for Hanxin (Eric) Chen. 

I am writing this document to introduce myself and tell how I communicate in order to avoid some misunderstanding in advance.

## Introduction

Hello, everyone! My name is Hanxin (Pronunciation: Han'Hsin) Chen (陈汉鑫), and I prefer to be called **Eric**. I am currently pursing my master's in CS at UC San Diego, and I will be graduating on March 2023. This summer, I am a new intern with M365-Exchange Team at Rubrik. I like watching movies (almost every genre), play badminton, table tennis, etc, and travelling.

## How I communicate

As you may know, English is my second language so sometimes I may be confused by some terminologies, buzz words, or may not understand some jokes. I am working on that. Forgive me if I look confused and frozen in front of the camera. I am just figuring out what to say. Also, if I say something that affends you, or hurts your feelings, or seems impolite , **please please please** let me know. I would never do this on purpose.

I prefer straightforward talking and I am open to any thought/advice/comment on me. I would appreaciate if you can give me some advice both on personal life and career, especially regarding work.

If there's anything I can help, just let me know. I am willing to help others.

## Things that make me annoyed

- All kinds of discriminations (i.e. Gender, Race, etc.)
- Snakes and Spiders (I am afraid of animals with too many legs or no leg. But I do love SpiderMan and using Python, LOL.)

## How to reach out to me

Just ping me, email me, or pull request this repo.
